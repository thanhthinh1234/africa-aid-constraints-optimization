# Plan 1: Fastest Route with no Constraints

+ Given the distance (Table 3) and the speed of the transportation used (Table 1) between each pair of cities, how can Gail McGovern and the IFRC most quickly move workers from the United States to each of the nine IFRC cities? How long will it take workers and supplies to reach each city using the quickest route? Which routes appear to have significant time bottlenecks that the IFRC should work to reduce? Provide a table and/or network map indicating the quickest route and travel time between the United States and African cities on the network.

+ Khartoum, Sudan is a potential bottomneck
  
    - plays as a main transit 
    - slight delay in Khartoum could lead to other delays to Niamey and Ndjamena 
    
+ The highest dual values come from R2(172.11) and R5(186.46)

    - loosening these constraints would have the most benefit and they are potential bottlenecks
    - these are routes to Libreville, Gabon (R2) and to Luanda, Angola (R5) from the US

+ Round the results to the nearest interger 

+ The minimum cost is $310,861,300.

+ After rounding the minimum cost is $310,869.00

+ We cover the 6 first-leg cities with a total of 3568 trips:
  
    - 3600 airplane trips
    - 1917 trips via ship
    - there are not any trips via trucks

+ For our 3 destinations, we cover 11369 trips through  1200 trips by airplanes and 10169 trips through trucks 

+ Our total capacity of nine cities is $1,360,071 which meets the requirement of the minimum aid (one million)

+ Trips details:
  
    - from New York, NY to Lusaka, Zambia: 267 airplanes
    - from New York, NY to Libreville,Gabon: 1167 ships
    - from New York, NY to Luanda, Angola: 542 ships 
    - from New York, NY to Dakar, Senegal: 208 ships
    - from Jacksonville, FL to Lusaka, Zambia: 733 airplanes
    - from Jacksonville, FL to Nairobi, Kenya: 1133 airplanes
    - from Jacksonville, FL to Khartoum, Sundan: 1467 airplanes
    - from Khartoum, Sudan to Niamey, Niger: 667 airplanes
    - from Libreville, Gabon to Kosongo, D.R.Congo: 10169 trucks
    - from Nairobi, Kenya to Ndjamena, Chad: 333 airplanes
    - from Khartoum, Sudan to Ndjamena, Chad: 200 airplanes

+ Khartoum is an important transit here, from here it will distribute aids to 2 cities which are Niamey, Niger and Ndjamena, Chad

+ R1(-0.37) and R2(-0.42) give the lowest dual values

    - this means these constraints would have the most effect on reducing costs and are potential bottlenecks
    - we would benefit the most from loosening the constraints of having to use all 500k supply from New York and Jacksonville

+ There are 7 routes which are not able to deliver any aids (0 tons)

+ The total aid arrived in all cities before getting distributed to the 3 final destinations: 1,022,164 (tons)

+ R12, R15, R21, R23, R27, R29 - all have the highest dual value of 150

    - these all have the most impact on our aid and if we were to loosen our constraints then we can increase the aid we send
    - we would benefit the most if we could lift these restrictions on travel
